# JamPal
A handy tool for musicians to have an overview of song chords and structure.

## About
Jampal is a handy tool best suited for small bands or hosting musicians. You can easily outline the song 
structure (verses,choruses, etc) and the chords, that are played.

It is best suited to run on a fullscreen fullHD TV (eg. from a RaspberryPI:-)

## Features
* quick song structure editing
* visual metronome with tap tempo
* colorizing song parts to quickly see the parts
* estimated song duration
* client side JavaScript, can be run offline
* notes
* quick keyboard control

## Requirements
* Chromium/Google Chrome browser
* Landscape 1920x1080 display (can run on HDready, but not as nicely)

## Demo
You can check demo (F11 for fullscreen before) [JamPal demo](https://belda.github.io/jampal/jampal.html)
